# PyBabyStats
This is a native Python library to access the Baby Stats API. Baby Stats (https://www.babystats.org/) is a fantastic free tool to track diaper changes, feedings, sleep, pumping, and your babies weight and sync between any device. The tool also presents a Public API (https://babystats.org/apidocs#publicAPIHelp) based on REST. This Python library allows native Python access and presents Python object as a result of calls to that API.

Currently there is no error handling in the code and I'm not an experienced Python developer so I appreciate any assistance with improving the code. I'm hoping to use it as a base for a custom component of Home Assistant to log stats and track stats natively there.
